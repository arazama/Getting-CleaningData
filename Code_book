CODE BOOK
There were several files in a carpet.
Some files were fore TEST and the others were for TRAIN

SUBJECT: Were identify by an integer ID
ACTIVITIES: 6 different activities that were performed by each subject
These activities are:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

Measurement means
All variables are the mean and the standard deviation of a measurement for each subject and activity. 
Some of the measurements were:
Time domain body acceleration mean along X, Y, and Z:
    MeanTimeBodyAccMeanX
    MeanTimeBodyAccMeanY
    MeanTimeBodyAccMeanZ
Time domain body acceleration standard deviation along X, Y, and Z:
    MeanTimeBodyAccStdDevX
    MeanTimeBodyAccStdDevY
    MeanTimeBodyAccStdDevZ

The variables that I used in my R code were the following:
TestData: Data for the Test
TestDataAct: Data for the Test per activity
TestDataSub: Data for the Test per subject
TrainData: Data for the Training
TrainDataAct: Data for the Training per activity
TrainDataSub: Data for the Test per subject
names: Activity names (1 to 6)
feature: All the different variables in X, Y, and Z
MergeAll: All the datas toguether with the proper activity name
Tidy: The final tidy data with all the means and standard deviations per feature, activity and subject.
